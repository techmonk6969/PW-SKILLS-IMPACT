    "   - **Calculation:** Variance is the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n",

    "**Effects on Measures of Central Tendency:**\n",
    "1. **Mean:**\n",
    "   - Outliers can significantly impact the mean. Since the mean is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of observations, extreme values can pull the mean towards them.\n",
    "   - Example: Consider the dataset [10, 15, 20, 25, 200]. The mean without the outlier is 18, but with the outlier, it becomes 74.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Median:**\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Mode:**\n",
    "   - Outliers have little effect on the mode since the mode is determined by the most frequently occurring value(s).\n",
    "   - Example: In the dataset [10, 15, 20, 25, 200], the mode is still 10, 15, 20, 25, or 200, depending on how it's defined.\n",
