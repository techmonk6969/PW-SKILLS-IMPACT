    "Influence on Descriptive Statistics: Outliers can significantly impact summary statistics such as mean and standard deviation. If not handled appropriately, these statistics may not accurately represent the central tendency and variability of the data.\n",

    "Handling Outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Removal: In some cases, outliers might be removed if they are due to data entry errors or do not represent valid data points.\n",

    "Transformation: Applying data transformations (e.g., log transformation) to make the distribution less skewed can be a strategy.\n",

    "Before deciding on a strategy for handling outliers, it's crucial to understand the nature of the data, the potential reasons for outliers, and the impact on the analysis. Additionally, outlier detection methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR method) can be applied to systematically identify and handle outliers."

    "\n",
    "3. **Flight Duration and Stopovers:**\n",
    "   - Consider how the duration and number of stopovers in flights impact prices. Longer flights or those with fewer stopovers might be more expensive during peak seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Airline Information:**\n",
    "   - Analyze the behavior of different airlines during different times of the year. Some airlines may experience increased demand during specific seasons.\n",

    "4. **Recommendations:**\n",
    "   - Based on your analysis, make recommendations for the peak travel season. This could include suggestions for when to offer promotions, optimize pricing strategies, or increase marketing efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interactive Dashboards:**\n",
    "   - If possible, create an interactive dashboard that allows your boss to explore the data dynamically. This can facilitate a deeper understanding of the patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Actionable Insights:**\n",
    "   - Provide actionable insights derived from your analysis. For instance, suggest specific time frames or events during which the travel agency should focus its marketing and promotional efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Limitations and Assumptions:**\n",
    "   - Clearly communicate any limitations or assumptions made during the analysis to ensure transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to tailor your presentation to the preferences of your boss and the specific goals of the travel agency. Clear and visually appealing presentations are often more effective in conveying complex information."
