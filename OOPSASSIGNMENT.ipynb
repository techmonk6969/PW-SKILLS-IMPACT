    "The close() function in Python is used to close an opened file. When you open a file using the open() function, a file object is created, and system resources are allocated to it. It is important to close the file using the close() method to release these system resources. Failing to close a file can lead to various issues and undesirable consequences. Here are some reasons why it is important to close a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Cleanup:\n",

    "When a file is opened, the operating system allocates resources such as file handles and buffers to manage the interaction with the file. Closing the file releases these resources, preventing potential resource leaks.\n",

    "Closing a file ensures that any buffered data is flushed to the file. Buffered data might not be immediately written to the file when each write operation occurs. Closing the file ensures that all changes are persisted to the file.\n",
    "File Locks:\n",

    "On some operating systems, leaving a file open may result in a file lock. Closing the file releases any locks associated with it, allowing other processes or parts of your program to access the file.\n",
    "Memory Usage:\n",

When the with block is entered, the __enter__ method is called, and when the block is exited (either normally or due to an exception), the __exit__ method is called. In the case of file handling, it ensures that the file is closed, even if an exception occurs within the block.\n",
