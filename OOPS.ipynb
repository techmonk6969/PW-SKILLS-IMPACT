    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It restricts access to some of the object's components, preventing direct modification. This helps in data hiding and ensures that an object's internal state remains consistent and valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction:** Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows the user to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which define a set of methods without providing implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance:** Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class can inherit properties and behavior from another class. It allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to reuse, extend, or modify the behavior of an existing class (base class or superclass). Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same method to behave differently based on the object it is called on. There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time polymorphism (achieved through method overloading and operator overloading) and runtime polymorphism (achieved through method overriding and dynamic method dispatch). Polymorphism enhances flexibility and extensibility in object-oriented systems."
