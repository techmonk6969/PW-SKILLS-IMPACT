    "\n",
    "5. **One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine):**\n",
    "   - **Approach:** One-Class SVM builds a model based on the majority class and identifies deviations from that norm.\n",
    "   - **Anomaly Detection:** Instances lying far from the decision boundary are considered anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Local Outlier Factor (LOF):**\n",
